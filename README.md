# Control Input Devices by Pose (Game Controller)

## Overview
This project stimulates the process of input devices using PyAutoGUI for key simulation and pose detection through the Mediapipe library. It enables you to control input devices, acting as a game controller, based on hand poses captured by a webcam.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the required libraries installed by running the following command:

Make sure to install the following Python packages before running the code:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)
- Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`) [temporary import]
```bash


pip install -r requirements.txt
